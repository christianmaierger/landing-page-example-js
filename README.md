## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## ProjectNotes

For this project although I also styled a bit of css and had to add a section in html, the focus was clearly on js. The task included writing functions to be used by event handlers to scroll to sections corresponding with anchor links in the navbar and building the navbar dynamically, so one can have as many content in the html section as ones like and does not have to worry about bulding the nav by hand. Issues I faced were manly how to check if a section is in the users view to style it as active and a basic async structure to have a responsive website even with different userinteractions in a close timeframe.
